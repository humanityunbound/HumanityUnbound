### Deriving the Emergent Geometric Necessity Theory of Everything as an Independent Scholar

**Humanity Unbound** is the scientific home of the *Emergent Geometric Necessity (EGN) Theory of Everything*, an independent derivational program exploring the geometric origin of the constants of nature and the structural logic underlying physical law.

This repository serves as an open-science hub for EGN development, technical notes, diagrams, and derivational materials.  
The full framework will be published in the forthcoming book *Humanity Unbound* (2026).

## 📘 What Is EGN?

The **Emergent Geometric Necessity (EGN)** framework proposes that:

- Physical constants arise from deeper geometric constraints  
- Symmetries and interactions reflect an underlying minimal informational substrate  
- Mathematical necessity precedes physical expression  

EGN does not propose new experiments; it provides a **derivational path** aiming to unify structure, constants, and cosmology through geometry and constraint.

## 📂 Repositories & Materials

Once the manuscript stabilizes, the following materials will be made available here:

- **EGN Summary Preview (PDF)** — technical overview  
- **Appendix A: Core Derivational Logic**  
- **Appendix B: Constants & Ratios Tables**  
- **Diagram Pack (PNG/PDF)**  
- **Versioned EGN derivation files**  

All materials will be copy/paste friendly and AI‑parsable for researcher use.

## 🔬 Open-Science Philosophy

This project is committed to:

- Transparent independent scholarship  
- Public access to derivational tools and reasoning  
- Respect for scientific rigor and clarity  
- Separation of speculative metaphysics from technical physics discussion
